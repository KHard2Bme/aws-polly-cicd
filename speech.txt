To make a classic grilled cheese sandwich, start by spreading softened butter (or mayonnaise for extra crispiness) on one side of two slices of bread. Place one slice, buttered side down, into a skillet or nonstick pan, then add one or two slices of your favorite melting cheese such as cheddar, American, or mozzarella. Top with the second slice of bread, buttered side up. Heat the skillet over medium-low to medium heat and cook the sandwich until the bottom slice is golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes. Carefully flip it and cook the other side for another 2 to 3 minutes, until the bread is toasted and the cheese is fully melted. Once done, remove from the pan, let it cool slightly, slice it in half if desired, and enjoy. You can enhance your grilled cheese by adding extras like sliced tomatoes, crispy bacon, or caramelized onions, and for even more flavor, try using different breads or cheeses like sourdough and Gruy√®r.
